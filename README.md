# Stuff I want to do
- A playdate-like fantasy console simulator (that I can put on a rasberry-pi and make a cool console thingy) 
- Forking and maintaining haxepunk (it has been dead for a while and it seems kinda cool)
- That stupid child curb stomping game idea
- Ipod-like media player (That I can put on a rasberry-pi and make a cool little ipod lol)
